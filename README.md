# Telecom Network Performance Dashboards (2G / 3G / 4G)

**Overview:**  
This project showcases a suite of Excel Power Pivot dashboards developed to monitor and analyze network performance across 2G, 3G, and 4G technologies. Built for internal use at a major telecom provider, these dashboards provide dynamic, filterable views of KPIs such as data usage, Erlang traffic, throughput, and more.

## ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel (Power Pivot, Pivot Tables, Slicers)**
- Custom formulas for ranking and categorization
- Interactive charts and time series plots

---

## ðŸ“Š 2G Dashboard Highlights
- Top 10/Bottom 10 sites by **Erlang traffic** and **data usage**
- Time series trendline for data and voice KPIs
- Region-level filters (e.g., Adamawa, Jos, Taraba)
- Total cell data tracked: **51,326**
- Purpose: Identify spikes and low-performing sites to optimize traffic distribution

---

## ðŸ“¶ 3G Dashboard Highlights
- Top 10/Bottom 10 3G nodes by **data volume** and **Erlang values**
- Slicers for region and cell names (UMUS002_S1â€“S6)
- Over **7.6 TB** tracked in top-performing nodes
- Purpose: Spot inefficient cells, support node-level optimization planning

---

## ðŸ“¡ 4G Dashboard Highlights
- Top 10/Bottom 10 sites and cells by **data consumption**
- Visual distribution by **categories Aâ€“D**
- Time series charts with visual spikes in usage
- Tracked over **130 TB** of traffic and **10M+ connections**
- Purpose: Support planning and optimization for LTE infrastructure
